# Docker Swarm - Commands

* `docker swarm init` is the command to create a new swarm. The node that you run the command on becomes the first manager and is switched to run in swarm mode.
* `docker swarm join-token` reveals the commands and tokens needed to join workers and managers to existing swarms. To expose the command to join a new manager, use the docker swarm join-token manager command. To get the command to join a worker, use the docker swarm join-token worker command.

* `docker node ls` lists all nodes in the swarm including which are managers and which is the leader.

* `docker service create` is the command to create a new service.

* `docker service ls` lists running services in the swarm and gives basic info on the state of the service and any replicas itâ€™s running.

* `docker service ps <service>` gives more detailed information about individual service replicas.

* `docker service inspect` gives very detailed information on a service. It accepts the --pretty flag to limit the information returned to the most important information.

* `docker service scale` lets you scale the number of replicas in a service up and down.

* `docker service update` lets you update many of the properties of a running service.

* `docker service logs `lets you view the logs of a service.
docker service rm is the command to delete a service from the swarm. Use it with caution as it deletes all service replicas without asking for confirmation.
