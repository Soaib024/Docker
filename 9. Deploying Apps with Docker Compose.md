# Deploying Apps with Docker Compose
Instead of gluing each microservice together with scripts and long docker commands, Docker Compose lets you describe an entire app in a single declarative configuration file, and deploy it with a single command.

The default name for a Compose YAML file is docker-compose.yml. However, you can use the -f flag to specify custom filenames.

## Compose files

```
version: "3.8"
services:
  web-fe:
    build: .
    command: python app.py
    ports:
      - target: 5000
        published: 5000
    networks:
      - counter-net
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: counter-vol
        target: /code
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
    networks:
      counter-net:

networks:
  counter-net:

volumes:
  counter-vol:
```

The first thing to note is that the file has 4 top-level keys:

* version
* services
* networks
* volumes

Other top-level keys exist, such as secrets and configs, but weâ€™re not looking at those right now.

The top-level s`ervices` key is where you define the different application service.

The top-level `networks` key tells Docker to create new networks. By default, Compose will create `bridge networks`. These are `single-host networks` that can only connect containers on the same Docker host. However, you can use the driver property to specify different network types.

The following code can be used in your Compose file to create a new overlay network called over-net that allows standalone containers to connect to it (attachable).

```
networks:
  over-net:
  driver: overlay
  attachable: true
```

The top-level `volumes` key is where you tell Docker to create new volumes.

As both services will be deployed onto the same counter-net network, they will be able to resolve each other by name.

```
docker-compose up
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose -f prod-equus-bass.yml up
docker-compose -f prod-equus-bass.yml up -d
```

### Managing an app with Compose

```
docker-compose down
docker-compose ps
docker-compose top # process running inside each container
docker-compose stop # stop the app without deleting its resources
docker-compose rm # delete the containers and networks the app is using, but it will not delete volumes or images
```
