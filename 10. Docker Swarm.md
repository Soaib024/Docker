# Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm is two main things:

* An enterprise-grade secure cluster of Docker hosts
* An engine for orchestrating microservices apps

On the clustering front, Swarm groups one or more Docker nodes and lets you manage them as a cluster. Out-of-the-box, you get an encrypted distributed cluster store, encrypted networks, mutual TLS, secure cluster join tokens, and a PKI that makes managing and rotating certificates a breeze. You can even non-disruptively add and remove nodes

Nodes are configured as managers or workers. Managers look after the control plane of the cluster.

The configuration and state of the swarm is held in a distributed etcd database located on all managers. It’s kept in memory and is extremely up-to-date.

TLS is so tightly integrated that it’s impossible to build a swarm without it. 

Swarm uses TLS to encrypt communications, authenticate nodes, and authorize roles. Automatic key rotation is also thrown in

The atomic unit of scheduling on a swarm is the service. This is a higher level construct that wraps some advanced features around containers. These include scaling, rolling updates, and simple rollbacks.

## Build a secure Swarm cluster

On the networking front, you need the following ports open on routers and firewalls between nodes:

* 2377/tcp: for secure client-to-swarm communication
* 7946/tcp and udp: for control plane gossip
* 4789/udp: for VXLAN-based overlay networks

The process of building a swarm is called initializing a swarm, and the high-level process is this: Initialize the first manager node > Join additional manager nodes > Join worker nodes > Done.

## Initializing a new swarm

Docker nodes that are not part of a swarm are said to be in single-engine mode. Once they’re added to a swarm they’re automatically switched into swarm mode.


### Swarm manager high availability (HA)
Swarm implements a form of active-passive multi-manager HA. This means that although you have multiple managers, only one of them is active at any given moment. This active manager is called the “leader”, and the leader is the only one that will ever issue live commands against the swarm. So, it’s only ever the leader that changes the config, or issues tasks to workers. If a follower manager (passive) receives commands for the swarm, it proxies them across to the leader.

swarm uses an implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm to maintain a consistent cluster state across multiple highly available managers.

On the topic of HA, the following two best practices apply:

* Deploy an odd number of managers -> leader election might be tricky incase of network partition
* Don’t deploy too many managers (3 or 5 is recommended) -> As with all consensus algorithms, more participants means more time required to achieve consensus

### Built-in Swarm security
Ton of built-in security that’s configured out-of-the-box with sensible defaults — CA settings, join tokens, mutual TLS, encrypted cluster store, encrypted networks, cryptographic node ID’s and more.

### Locking a Swarm
Docker allows you to lock a swarm with the Autolock feature. This forces restarted managers to present the cluster unlock key before being admitted back into the cluster.

```
$ docker swarm update --autolock=true
Swarm updated.
To unlock a swarm manager after it restarts, run the `docker swarm unlock` command and 
provide the following key:

    SWMKEY-1-5+ICW2kRxPxZrVyBDWzBkzZdSd0Yc7Cl2o4Uuf9NPU4

Please remember to store this key in a password manager, since without it you will not be able
to restart the manager.
```

```
docker swarm unlock-key
```

Run this command from restarted manager
```
$ docker swarm unlock
Please enter unlock key: <enter your key>
```

Locking your swarm and protecting the unlock key is recommended for production environments.

## Swarm services
Services are a new construct introduced with Docker 1.12, and they only apply to swarm mode.

You can create services in one of two ways:

* Imperatively on the command line with docker service create
* Declaratively with a stack file

Creating service with 5 replica

```
docker service create --name web-fe \
   -p 8080:8080 \
   --replicas 5 \
   nigelpoulton/pluralsight-docker-ci
```
The command was sent to a manager node, and the manager acting as leader instantiated 5 replicas across the swarm — remember that swarm managers also act as workers.

The swarm leader also ensures a copy of the service’s desired state was stored on the cluster and replicated to every manager.

## Viewing and inspecting services

`docker service ls`

`docker service ps <service name/ID>`

`docker service inspect --pretty <service name/ID>`

### Replicated vs global services
The default replication mode of a service is replicated. This deploys a desired number of replicas and distributes them as evenly as possible across the cluster.

The other mode is `global`, which runs a single replica on every node in the swarm.

To deploy a global service you need to pass the `--mode global` flag to the docker service create command.
