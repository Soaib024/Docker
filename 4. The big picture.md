# The big picture

Components of docker
* Docker client
* Docker daemon (sometimes called the “Docker engine”)

The daemon implements the runtime, API and everything else required to run Docker

In a default Linux installation, the client talks to the daemon via a local IPC/Unix socket at /var/run/docker.sock. On Windows this happens via a named pipe at npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine. 

## The Ops Perspective

### Images
Docker image contains an OS filesystem, an application, and all application dependencies, it’s like a virtual machine template or a class, image contains enough of an operating system (OS), as well as all the code and dependencies to run whatever application it’s designed for.

### Containers
Now that we have an image pulled locally, we can use the `docker container run` command to launch a container from it.

`docker container run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash`
* The `-it` flags tell Docker to make the container interactive and to attach the current shell to the container’s terminal

```
soaib@soaib:~/Public/Docker$ docker container run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
root@f06097129d17:/# ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
      1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
      9 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```
The Linux container only has two processes:

* PID 1. This is the /bin/bash process that we told the container to run with the docker container run command.
* PID 9. This is the ps -elf command/process that we ran to list the running processes, this is short lived process

### Attaching to running containers
`docker container exec <options> <container-name or container-id> <command/app>`

example: `docker container exec -it vigilant_borg bash`

## The Dev Perspective

* Write application and dockerfile
* Build image

# Chapter Summary
In the Ops section of the chapter you downloaded a Docker image, launched a container from it, logged into the container, executed a command inside of it, and then stopped and deleted the container.

In the Dev section, you containerized a simple application by pulling some source code from GitHub and building it into an image using instructions in a Dockerfile. You then ran the containerized app.

This big picture view should help you with the up-coming chapters where we will dig deeper into images and containers.
